Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/sudhanshuranjanAki/websitedevelopment/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
